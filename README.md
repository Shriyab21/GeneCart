# GeneCart
The project is an idea of developing an application that will enable researchers to integrate, analyze, and visualize the results from their experiments. The application can be applied to any organism. I am building a platform where researchers will store their data (like genes), learn more about their genes, and allow them to compare lists of genes from different experiments. For example in the lab, researchers can compare genes that make plants efficient in using nitrogen, which leads to less pollution, to genes that allow plants to tolerate dry weather, which may result due to climate change. Using the application, the researchers will be able to determine which plant or a variety of a plant will be able to tolerate the temperature rise and the decrease in water. Since performing hundreds of thousands of experiments are very costly, this predictive model along with many visualizations will help researchers learn interesting facts about their experiment and design new experiments to test their hypothesis.
